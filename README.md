[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/twasyl/jstackfx.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/twasyl/jstackfx)

# Context

It is not an easy task to analyse thread dumps as files generated by the `jstack` tool provides raw _text files_.
This is why I'm developing **JStackFX**.

# Requirements

JStackFX requires the latest JDK 8 available on your system.

# Build

As JStackFX is currently under development, you have to build it manually in order to use it. In order to build it, ensure the JDK 8 is available and execute the following command:

```shell
gradlew clean distZip
```

# Execution

In order to start JStackFX, unzip the `build/distributions/JStackFX-<version>.zip` archive and start a command line within the unzipped folder. Execute the following command:

```shell
java -jar jstackfx-<version>.jar
```

In order to start JStackFX and open directly a dump file you can use the following command:

```shell
java -jar jstackfx-<version>.jar --file=/path/to/dump.txt
```
